# EcoCreatureSim
 
This simulation will use genes to demonstrate natural selection and a natural ecosystem within a 2D world. The genes will dictate the attributes and the behavior of the creatures who will evolve through reproduction and mutations.

## Class comments

The comments are set up in the following way consistently throughout the programs classes:

	# <Class Name>
	# ----------------------------------
	# [Description of the class]

## Gene Structure

The genes will be made up of random letters or possibly numbers while will dictate their attributes and behaviors. One <Gene> object will be made up of multiple <Genome> objects, and one Gene may look like one of the following:

	ex 1. "DIUCY", "KLESD", "APCVM"

	ex 2. "MWHAS", "CPASE"

The length of the gene represents the complexity of the creature, I think they will start with a few genes and then evolve through mutations which may add a gene.
